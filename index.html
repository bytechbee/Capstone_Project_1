                            <li>I am currently developing software for the latest generations of rain light-humidity sensors, being part of a large international team. The application part is developed in MATLAB and Simulink, which involves mastering the knowledge of statistical analysis and numerical calculation, as well as performing simulations on dynamic embedded systems using mathematical models.              
                            </li>
                            <li>My core responsibility is implementation based on speciﬁcations, including problem analysis,ﬁnding solutions and documentation of implementation. Thus, I became familiar with many tools, the most important of which are Vector CANoe and Vector CANApe.
